									<h1>Soccer at<br />
									Columbia FC</h1>
									<p>In my free time I love playing soccer with my semi-professional soccer team based in Columbia, MD. </p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/team.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Soccer holds significant prominence in my life, serving as both a passion and a means of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Beyond the sheer enjoyment derived from playing, the sport plays a pivotal role in keeping me physically fit. Moreover, engaging in soccer acts as a cathartic release, effectively mitigating stressors and enhancing my ability to concentrate on professional responsibilities when I am in the office. This harmonious balance between recreation and well-being contributes substantially to my overall productivity and work-life equilibrium. </p>
								<p>Engaging in soccer has significantly contributed to the honing of essential life skills such as leadership and communication, shaping my character for day-to-day challenges. During my four seasons with Columbia FC, our team achieved notable success, reaching three finals in the Division 1 Maryland Majors League and securing victory twice. This journey has not only adorned me with trophies and accolades but has also provided unique opportunities, including a meeting with Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott. Throughout this experience, I have embraced the dual roles of a leader and a team player, learning valuable lessons in collaboration and effective communication. Gratitude extends to my dedicated teammates and coaches whose support has been instrumental in my personal and athletic growth.</p>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/family.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>In my leisure moments, I derive immense joy from devoting quality time to my family, an activity that I consider both rejuvenating and profoundly humbling. The bonds forged during these moments serve as a source of inspiration, as my family challenges and guides me in my continuous journey towards becoming a more virtuous Christian. Notably, my mother, portrayed in the image above, stands as a beacon of resilience and determination. Overcoming numerous obstacles, she emerged as an evangelist in Ethiopia during a time when societal norms restricted women from assuming leadership roles within the church. Her life narrative serves as a constant reminder that divine providence is steadfast, underscoring the notion that God is perpetually vigilant over my endeavors. In closing, I share a cherished biblical verse: "Submit to God and be at peace with Him; in this way, prosperity will come to you." - Job 22:21.</p>
